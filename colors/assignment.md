# Assignment

Create a [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) stylesheet to display the [colors.html](colors.html) document as shown here:

![](colors.png)

The color of the middle bar is `plum`; however, it must be provided as a parameter in the stylesheet to be able to change it. The colors of the other bars must be chosen automatically. The layout must fill the entire browser window.

You must use the [`color.adjust()`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color#adjust) function of the [`sass:color`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color) module with the `$hue` and `$lightness` arguments.
